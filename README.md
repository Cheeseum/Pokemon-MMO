## Dependencies
* coffeescript

## Compiling
* run `cake build` for one-time compile
* Alternatively, run `cake watch` for automated compiling.

## Usage
* Simply open index.html in your favorite HTML5 compatible browser.
* Some browsers (chromium) will prevent map loading from working. If this is the case:
    * run a small webserver in the cloned repo dir (php -S localhost:8000 works well)
    * open localhost:8000 instead of index.html

## Style
* _4 spaces_ indentation for code readability.
* Use coffeescript dialogue whenever possible and sane (or=, not, unless, etc)
